TODO - LOW PRIORITY
1. Changing souts into logs 
2. Changing e.printstacktrace into logs 
3. Making extension of the script for installing code in the platform
4. Making a script to enable and disable the java application. 
5. Make java code to automatically build the code using a pipeline structure. 
6. Integrate Astra Demo to Orbec


TODO - HIGH PRIORITY
0. Refactor the Wrapper project (done)
1. Integrate Keis code into your own
    -> Add Keys Code (Done)
    -> Look into OpenNI examples (Done)
    -> Look into Astra Examples (Partially Done)
        -> Fails with Segmentation Faults
        -> make install step? ()
            -> bluez
            -> folder creation

    -> Add Open CV to your computer and astra to figure out how to integrate OpenCV (Done)
    -> Start changing out code to encorporate Keis Code into your own. (Done)
    -> Add Local GAV information of OpenCV (Done)
    -> Test Run Depth Recording
    -> Complete Interpretation of all the messages
        -> Document it
        -> Add it into integration test framework
        ->
2. Ensure bluetooth Connectivity in Persee:
    -> https://www.jaredwolff.com/get-started-with-bluetooth-low-energy/ (DONE)
    -> Issue Related to bad file state === https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36907135/bluetooth-low-energy-input-output-error
    ->

Hypothesis:
System.loadLibary -> get libraries from the system file
                  -> For this to happen must be isntalled in the system library
                  -> If the code is installed in the right place. loadLibrary should automatically pick the required library and build the code.
                  ->


- Completed building the application till the sample example part.
- You need to understand how the libraries are taken in this sample example and then you should be good.
- There also seems to be a jar that gets built internally which is a good thig.
- You can repurpose this jar to use it in your jar file.
-> Install OpenCV in your system so that you can properly do development for openCV (done)
->
