## Affective Emotion Recording

I migrated this repository from my research project folder to my git repository for everyones viewing. This is part of the project, I have worked on. Most of the work in the work in the project is done by me. Any code that is not my own, is mentioned at the top of the class file. 

Our project aims to make an open affective emotion recording apparatus. The overall apparatus setup contains shell scripts for installation and configuration of the camera setup, a mobile application for sending user commands and messages and the backend application (available in this repository) for the setup.
